During the testing process, I encountered several bugs in my HTML and CSS code. To identify and address these issues, I utilized the W3C validator, a widely recognized tool for validating web documents. The validator helped me pinpoint specific errors and warnings within my code, such as incorrect syntax, missing elements, or deprecated attributes.

Once I identified the bugs through the validator, I sought assistance from online sources to gain a better understanding of how to resolve them. One of the valuable resources I utilized was Stack Overflow, a popular question-and-answer platform for programmers. By searching for similar issues or errors encountered by other developers, I could often find relevant discussions, solutions, and insights into resolving specific coding problems.

With the guidance acquired from these online sources, I proceeded to correct the bugs in my HTML and CSS code. I carefully implemented the suggested fixes, taking into consideration best practices and recommendations provided by the community. This iterative process of identifying bugs, seeking guidance, and implementing solutions helped me address the issues and improve the overall quality of my website.

By utilizing the W3C validator and leveraging online resources like Stack Overflow, I was able to identify and rectify the bugs in my code, ensuring that my website adheres to web standards, functions correctly, and provides an optimal user experience.
